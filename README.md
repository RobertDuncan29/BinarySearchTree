# BinarySearchTree
In this project I coded my onw interation of a Binary Search Tree. This project allows a user to make a tree that will accurately distribute integer values
compared to that of the root node. If the value being added is less it is placed in the left tree, if it is greater it is placed in the right tree. The user can continue
to add as many integer values as they would like. The user will also be able to display the inorder display of this information which will show the values from 
lowest to highest. Users can also delete nodes with certain values and the binary search tree will reconfigure itself to continue to abide by its rules. There are 
still some flaws and issues I have run into with this code as it pertains to different ways to print the information as well as some logic issues with deleting some of
the nodes.
